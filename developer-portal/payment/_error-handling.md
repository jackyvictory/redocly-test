## Error handling

### For HTTP POST request to EVO Cloud
It is suggested to wait at least 45 seconds after the request is sent to EVO Cloud. If you don't receive the response within the time frame, you need to retrieve the result from EVO Cloud, follow Step 6 to initiate the request.

### For HTTP GET request to EVO Cloud
You can initiate the request several times until you get the result, and it is suggested to wait at least 45 seconds before you initiate the subsequent request. If you still fail to receive the result after several times of the request, you can initiate a Cancel or Refund request (based on your capture mode) to cancel the payment. See chapter After Payment for more details.
