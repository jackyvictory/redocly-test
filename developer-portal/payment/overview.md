# Overview

To accept payment, EVO Cloud API provides the ability of both Instant payment and Placing a hold following a capture both in E-Commerce and In-Store payment scenario (In-Store payment scenario only supports Instant payment now).

1. Instant payment: the most common retail payment processed in real-time.

2. Placing a hold following a capture: Place a hold to reserve fund now but capture it only after completing a service. It only applies to the card payment. When a payment is authorized, the bank guarantees the amount and holds it on the user's card for several days (depending on the
bank). Then, use further actions Capture or Cancel to complete or cancel the payment. See chapter After Payment for more details.
