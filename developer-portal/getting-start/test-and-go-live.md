# Test and go live

When your integration gets ready, run the test scripts with the parameters provided by your EVO Cloud account manager and submit the test result. You can request your account manager for the EVO Cloud technical support if you get any issues regarding the integration.

Once the EVO Cloud team reviews your test result, your account manager will contact you to go ahead with the required steps to live your integration.
